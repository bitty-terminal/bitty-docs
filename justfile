# Publish a redacted CarryCtx snapshot inside this repo (commander merge
# closeout only; never a git hook). `carryctx export --publication` redacts the
# bundle, stamps manifest.redacted, and commits one snapshot to the fixed ref
# `refs/heads/carryctx-snapshots`; the target pushes that branch only when the
# local ref advanced (native carryctx commits one snapshot per export, so a
# re-run publishes again rather than no-opping). Canonical closeout runs from
# the primary checkout on branch main
# (`cd "$BITTY_WORKSPACE/bitty-docs" && just workflow-publish`); a detached or
# feature worktree records that branch as the snapshot source. Dry run
# validates the export and writes neither the ref nor the remote.
